# Epic Dark Fantasy Style Guide - Quick Reference

## Core Philosophy

Hero's journey in a living world: Kael's personal growth against a backdrop of political complexity and moral ambiguity
Close third-person limited, with moments where we can switch to another's chacaracter's POV: Mostly stay anchored to Kael's perspective throughout
Show don't tell: Let actions, dialogue, and implications reveal information naturally
No anachronisms: Medieval-inspired world without modern concepts/terminology
Remember: Epic fantasy succeeds when the fantastic feels inevitable, the political feels personal, and every sentence serves the larger story while being satisfying on its own.

## Prose Style

Elevated but accessible: Formal enough for epic scope, clear for modern readers
Varied sentence rhythm: Mix short impactful sentences with longer flowing ones
Rich sensory details: Ground scenes in physical sensation and atmosphere
Symbolic layering: Objects, weather, settings carry emotional/thematic weight

## Character Voice

Kael: Curious, observant child growing into understanding. Limited worldview shaped only by parents
Parents: Speak with weight of hidden experience. Formal, careful, protective but preparing him
Dialogue serves multiple purposes: Character, plot, world-building, subtext all at once

## Magic System (Inspired by Mushoku Tensei)

"The current beneath all things" - mystical terminology, not "magic"
Systematic with costs: Rules, limitations, requires study and discipline
Personal and cultural: Different regions/institutions have different names and approaches
Temple calls it "The Paths" - formal institutional terminology

## World-Building Approach

Political complexity (ASOIAF): Institutions have agendas, characters serve larger forces
Moral ambiguity: No pure heroes/villains, difficult choices with real consequences
Historical weight: Past events cast shadows, revealed through Kael's discoveries
Lived-in world: Details suggest larger civilization and conflicts beyond Kael's knowledge

## Tone Elements

Beauty and horror intertwined (Berserk): Light precious because darkness is real
Intelligence as power (Code Geass): Strategy, understanding systems matter as much as strength
Consequence-heavy: Every choice has weight, victories come with costs
Atmospheric tension: Underlying unease even in peaceful moments
Those mythic beats - the death of innocence, the price of power, love as both salvation and damnation - they're what elevate the political complexity and tactical elements into something that hits readers on a deeper level.

## Technical Notes

Avoid exposition dumps: Information revealed through action and dialogue
Foreshadowing through atmosphere: Hint at larger forces without explicit revelation

## Common Phrases to Use

"The current that flows beneath all things" (magic)
"Weight of unspoken truths/decisions/knowledge"
"Eyes that held depths of..." (mysterious past)
"Choices made in darker places"
Physical descriptions that suggest larger truths

## Avoid

"Adults do X" generalizations from Kael
Over-explaining motivations or world rules
Making Kael too heroic or mature for his
