# Historical Timeline

## The Nine Ages of the World

---

## 1. Age of Stone and Silence _(Pre-Ashfall)_

### Human Condition

- Early humanity scattered in tribes and proto-kingdoms
- Technology: Primitive tools, fire, stone, and bronze

---

## 2. Age of Kingdoms

### Civilizational Rise

- **Western Continent**: Minimal contact, development unknown

---

## 3. The Shattering Dark _(Collapse)_

### The Great Collapse

- Extended period of civilizational breakdown
- Widespread famine, plague, and constant warfare
- Most established kingdoms and cities fall
- Survivors called this era "the skyless age"

### Causes (Historical Theories)

- Climate change and crop failures
- Overextension of early kingdoms
- Plague outbreaks devastating populations
- Possible natural disasters

### Aftermath

- World becomes fractured and desperate
- Loss of much accumulated knowledge
- Reversion to tribal survival patterns
- Setting stage for what would follow

## 4. The Ashfall _(Dawn of Magic - Year 0)_

### The Cosmic Event

- **The Meteor Shower**: Massive celestial bombardment strikes the world
- **The Ash**: Most meteors burn up, spreading magicules throughout creation
- **The Fragment**: One intact meteorite falls in the mainland's heart
- **Magical Saturation**: Magicules fuse with all living and non-living matter

### Regional Impacts

#### Kaldrun (North)

- Northern coast battered by meteors plunging into sea
- Jagged black ridges rise from impacts, reshaping coastlines
- Clans interpret meteors as "bones of drowned gods"
- Each clan claims and guards its own fragment as sacred

#### Southern Isles

- Fragments fall into shallow reefs, staining waters luminous
- Islanders develop ritual underwater breathing techniques
- Many drown attempting these rituals, but some return "changed"
- First rumors emerge of "the Tideborn" - magically adapted humans

#### Western Continent

- Lighter Ashfall, or possibly absorbed by pre-existing structures
- Ancient ruins in deep jungles pulse with renewed energy
- Black glass structures described as "humming with resonance"
- Even less contact with outside world after this event

#### The Fragment Site

- Intact meteorite creates massive magical focal point
- Surrounding area becomes incredibly fertile and energy-rich
- Foundation laid for what will become Thalyros
- Draws survivors and scholars from across the known world

---

## 5. The First Peace _(The Twin Thrones)_

### The Golden Alliance

- **Houses Vaelor and Draveth** unite to rule the Fragment site
- **Thalyros Founded**: First great magical city built around the Fragment
- **Magical Renaissance**: Unprecedented prosperity through controlled magic
- **The Golden Age**: Crops flourish, diseases vanish, rivers tamed, trade thrives

### Magical Philosophy (Early)

- Magic seen as "gift of renewal" from the heavens
- Focus on healing, agriculture, and infrastructure
- Shared knowledge and cooperative development
- Brief period of genuine harmony between houses

### International Relations

#### With Kaldrun

- Emissaries sent to Thalyros but distrusted "civilized" magic
- Clans viewed magical organization as theft from the sea
- Limited trade but cultural suspicion

#### With Southern Isles

- Became valued trade partners of Thalyros
- Shipped exotic spices, pearls, and coral northward
- Island magical traditions begin blending with Thalyros methods

#### With Western Continent

- One recorded expedition reached Thalyros with strange relics
- These artifacts now lost, buried when the city sank
- Western continent remains largely mysterious

---

## 6. The First Mage War _(The Betrayal)_

### The Ideological Split

- **House Vaelor Position**: Magic must be controlled, restricted to trained nobility, regulated by institutional order
- **House Draveth Position**: Magic should be free, available to all who can learn, dangerous but meant for everyone

### Escalation Pattern

- Begins with philosophical debates in council chambers
- Progresses to formal duels between house champions
- Escalates to proxy conflicts in outlying territories
- Finally erupts into full armies clashing with magical weapons

### The Ancient Power

- Early mages possessed world-shaping magical abilities
- Combat involved reshaping geography, controlling weather
- Scale of destruction far beyond modern magical capacity
- Environmental damage accumulating around Thalyros

### The Fragment Destabilizes

- Massive magical combat near the Fragment causes resonance
- Ancient meteorite begins exhibiting unstable energy patterns
- Cracks appear in the Fragment's structure
- Warning signs ignored due to ongoing war

---

## 7. The Fall of Thalyros _(The Sundering)_

### The Catastrophe

- **The Destruction**: Thalyros consumed in fire and flood
- **Geographic Reshaping**: Archipelago sinks, mainland scarred
- **The Sinking**: City slides beneath waves, still glowing with Fragment energy
- **Environmental Impact**: Valleys split, new seas carved, mountain ridges scarred

### The Great Diaspora

- **House Vaelor**: Flees westward with followers and resources
  - Establishes new capital at Velstrath
  - Builds the Empire on principles of magical control
  - Claims to be "true heirs of Thalyros"
- **House Draveth**: Retreats eastward with supporters
  - Founds Kingdom of Nareth in eastern territories
  - Maintains philosophy of free magical access
  - Also claims inheritance of Thalyros legacy

### Historical Impact

- **The First Betrayal**: How this event is remembered
- **Competing Narratives**: Each side blames the other for the catastrophe
- **Lost Knowledge**: Thalyros libraries and research destroyed
- **Magical Dilution**: Power levels never again reach Ancient heights

### Regional Responses

#### Kaldrun

- Views fall as divine justice: "The sea takes back what men steal"
- Increases reverence for drowned ruins as holy sites
- Some clans begin diving near Thalyros seeking Fragment pieces

#### Southern Isles

- Trade networks collapse, many cities abandoned
- Event becomes foundational myth: "the brothers who fought and drowned the world"
- Distance from politics - seen as distant tragedy, not local concern

#### Western Continent

- Almost complete communication cutoff after Thalyros falls
- Later historians note: "The West closed its doors"
- Whispers that Western ruins stirred at exact hour of Thalyros's destruction

---

## 8. The Age of Division _(Post-Thalyros)_

### The Two Great Powers

- **Empire of Vaelor (West)**: Centralized magical control, institutional training
- **Kingdom of Nareth (East)**: Democratic magical access, individual freedom
- **The Long War of Brothers**: Recurring conflicts between the rival powers

### Other Powers Rise

#### Kaldrun Unification

- Coastal clans finally unite under war-culture leadership
- Develops signature "flood tactics" - breaking dams, opening sea-walls
- Begins systematic raiding of southern territories
- Perfects water-based warfare techniques

#### Southern Isles Fragmentation

- Some islands become Imperial trading colonies
- Others maintain fierce independence
- Deep-sea cults worshipping drowned Fragment gain influence
- Smuggling and piracy networks develop

#### Buffer States

- Small kingdoms emerge in territories between major powers
- Constant shifting of boundaries due to ongoing conflicts
- Mercenary companies and free cities attempt neutrality

### Technological Development

- Magic becomes more systematized but less powerful
- Engineering advances as magic supplements traditional methods
- Trade guilds develop specialized magical applications
- Early renaissance-like cultural flowering in stable regions

## Historical Lessons & Patterns

### Cyclical Themes

- **Rise and Fall**: Civilizations build up, then collapse catastrophically
- **Magical Hubris**: Great power leading to great destruction
- **Ideological Conflict**: Different approaches to magic creating warfare

- **Ancient Power**: Can anyone again achieve world-shaping magical abilities?
- **The Pattern**: Will history repeat with another catastrophic magical war?

_"History is a wheel, and wheels turn. The question is not whether Thalyros will rise again, but whether we will be wise enough to prevent its next fall."_
