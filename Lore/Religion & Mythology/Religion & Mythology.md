# Religion & Mythology

## The Divine Pantheon Framework

### Fundamental Question

Were the legendary figures gods who manifested as masters of magic, or were they simply the most powerful mages in history who were mythologized into divine status? This ambiguity allows for both religious faith and scholarly skepticism to coexist.

### The Pantheon Structure

- **Classical Six**: Gods associated with common magical affinities (generally accepted)
- **Forbidden Three**: Devils associated with rare affinities (universally feared)
- **Regional Variations**: Different cultures emphasize different aspects of the same deities
